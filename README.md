# BF.js

A simple Javascript Brainfuck implementation for educational purposes. 

## About

This is a simple Brainfuck interpreter written in Javascript. 
Its purpose was to show students how the Brainfuck language works. 
The interpreter shows the used memory location with their content as well as the output as number and characters. 
Furthermore, the instruction pointer is visualized to be able to follow the execution. The only functionality that is provided is running the whole program or stepping through it.

## Setup

Just open the `index.html` in a browser. The UI should be self-explanatory.
